1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial
    a. How this application does it -
    
    This application builts privacy in from the beginning by obfuscating 
    critical data like the voter id and voter name.
    
    b. What we can do better -

2. Privacy as the Default
    a. How this application does it -
    
    The application only requests and stores minimal privacy data
    which is absolutely required for the use case.
    
    b. What we can do better -

3. Privacy Embedded into Design
    a. How this application does it -
    
    The application even takes care to redact privacy data from 
    voters comments automatically. 
    This is much better than just asking the voter to not use
    any privacy data in her comment.
    
    b. What we can do better -

4. Full Functionality — Postive-Sum, not Zero-Sum
    a. How this application does it -
    
    An example is the comment functionality. One could just 
    live without it. But the application provides a 
    better user experience by applying privacy engineering.
    
    b. What we can do better -

5. End-to-End Security — Lifecycle Protection
    a. How this application does it -
    
    Privacy data is stored in an encrypted form in the database. 
    So even if someone should gain access to a leaked database,
    she wont be able to find out how someone voted.
    
    b. What we can do better -

    Http communication should also be encrypted via https.
    Additionally the database itself could be encrypted.

6. Visibility and Transparency
    
    a. How this application does it -
    
    The application communicates clearly to the voter what
    kind of data is being stored and how.
    It also informs the voter that he can deregister after
    voting.
    
    b. What we can do better -

    The application could offer a web interface to the voter
    to immediately let him delete his data after voting or
    even delete the data automatically after some time.
    Its not quite clear what happens to the data when the voter
    does not ask for deregistration (how long will it be kept, what else might it be used for)

7. Respect for User Privacy
    a. How this application does it -
    
    Offering the voter to deregister and communicating that fact
    upfront before voting is a clear sign of respect for voters
    privacy.

    b. What we can do better -

    Tell the voter what of her data, how long and why it will be stored, as well
    as deleting it automatically.
    Also it might not be clear what deregistration means and what kind of 
    data it will delete.
